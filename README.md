# [Resume Desansiedad Data Analysis](#Table-Of-Contents)
This is a data analysis I made to the team of desansiedad, desansiedad is a mexican enterprise that offers online professional treatment for anxiety, their web page and therefore their google analytics is an important asset to analyse, here I did most of the analysis with google data studio, and just a little with python, pandas, matplotlib, numpy. The challenge was on choosing the correct filters, the data was clean by origin.
